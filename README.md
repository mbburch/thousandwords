This was an individual project in Module 3 at Turing School of Software & Design. The project description can be found here: [Project Outline](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)

## Project Description

In this project, I focused on consuming and working with data from the Twitter API. I worked with the OAuth protocol to authenticate users with Twitter, and I used various testing techniques to allow me to test against the third-party data.

## Learning Goals

* Learn to consume data from third-party APIs
* Continue to emphasize performance, UI, and overall user experience
* Continue using TDD to drive all layers of development
* Coordinate with project stakeholders to produce quality code and product
* This project will be completed individually over a period of 4 days.

## Technical Expectations

* Use an Omniauth authentication library for authenticating users with the 3rd-party service.
* Mimic the interface functionality of Twitter.
* Consume an external API to get real data and interact with a third-party service.
